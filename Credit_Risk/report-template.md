## Overview of the Analysis
In this analysis we will use machine learning models in order to predict the healthiness or riskiness of loans.

Logistic regression was used for this analysis. In order to test the modelâ€™s accuracy the data was split into two groups, one to train the model and one to compare in order to get the accucracy. 



## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Balanced accuracy: 96.7%
  * Healthy loan precison: 100%
  * High-risk loan precision: 84%
  * Healthy loan recall: 99%
  * High-risk loan recall: 94%



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Balanced accuracy: 99.3%
  * Healthy loan precison: 99%
  * High-risk loan precision: 99%
  * Healthy loan recall: 100%
  * High-risk loan recall: 84%

## Summary
 Both models provide good accuracy and are recommended, that being said, the model number 2 does have an increase on accuracy and high-risk precision.
